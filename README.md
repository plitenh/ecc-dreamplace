# ecc-dreamplace

`ecc-dreamplace` is an ECC-integrated placement engine based on
[DREAMPlace](https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace). It keeps the
GPU/CPU analytical placement foundation from DREAMPlace and extends it for the
ECC physical-design data flow, differentiable timing analysis, timing-aware
net weighting, and ECC early-global-routing driven routability optimization.

This repository is packaged as a Python wheel for the
[ECOS Studio](https://github.com/openecos-projects/ecos-studio) silicon design
platform. The original upstream DREAMPlace README is preserved in
[README_DREAMPlace.md](README_DREAMPlace.md), and the inherited AutoDMP notes
are preserved in [README_AutoDMP.md](README_AutoDMP.md).

## What Is New Compared with DREAMPlace?

### ECC Data-Flow Integration

`ecc-dreamplace` can run placement directly from the ECC data flow instead of
requiring a standalone DREAMPlace benchmark conversion path.

- `dreamplace/Placer.py` exposes `Placer.setup_rawdb(ecc_module)` to initialize
  DREAMPlace from an ECC module.
- `dreamplace/macroPlaceDB.py` builds the Python placement database from ECC
  data via `ecc_module.pydb(...)`.
- Placement results can be written back through ECC with
  `ecc_module.write_placement_back(...)` / `ecc_module.def_save(...)`.

### PyTorch-Based Differentiable STA

The repository adds a PyTorch-based static timing analysis path that supports
both forward timing evaluation and backward timing-gradient computation.

The timing path includes:

- Steiner topology construction in `dreamplace/ops/steiner_topo/`.
- Elmore-delay net modeling in `dreamplace/ops/rc_timing/`.
- Timing-graph propagation in `dreamplace/ops/timing_propagation/`.
- Integration with the placement objective in `dreamplace/PlaceObj.py`.

With `with_sta` enabled, the placer builds timing propagation and Elmore-delay
operators during placement initialization. The timing objective computes
Steiner topology, net delay, slew/load propagation, and WNS/TNS-style timing
metrics in the PyTorch computation graph.

### Timing-Driven Placement and Net Weighting

The repository implements timing-aware controls commonly used in recent
timing-driven placement flows, including net-level and pin-to-pin weighting.
The main configuration knobs are:

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `enable_net_weighting` | Enable timing-aware net weighting during global placement. |
| `net_weighting_scheme` | Select the net-weighting scheme, currently configured for options such as `adam` and `lilith`. |
| `max_net_weight` | Cap timing-driven net weights, or use `inf` for no cap. |
| `pin2pin_net_weighting` | Enable pin-to-pin timing weighting. |
| `pin2pin_weight` | Base multiplier for pin-to-pin timing weights. |
| `timing_eval_flag` | Enable timing evaluation reporting. |
| `risa_weights` | Use RISA-style weighted smooth HPWL to improve correlation with routed/Steiner wirelength. |

Note: `timing_opt_flag` is a legacy DREAMPlace/OpenTimer flag in this fork.
It is intentionally marked as unsupported because the old OpenTimer integration
has been removed. Use the ECC-integrated STA path controlled by `with_sta`,
`differentiable_timing_obj`, and the net-weighting parameters above.

### ECC EGR-Based Routability Inflation

`ecc-dreamplace` supports routability-driven cell inflation using ECC/iRT early
global routing feedback.

- `dreamplace/ops/irt_egr/` wraps the ECC/iRT early global routing path.
- `dreamplace/PlaceObj.py` builds `irt_egr_congestion_map_op` when routability
  optimization is enabled.
- `dreamplace/ops/adjust_node_area/` inflates movable-cell areas from route and
  pin utilization maps.

Relevant configuration knobs include:

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `routability_opt_flag` | Enable routability-driven global placement. |
| `adjust_nctugr_area_flag` | Use the ECC/iRT EGR route map for route-area adjustment. The legacy parameter name is retained for configuration compatibility. |
| `adjust_rudy_area_flag` | Use RUDY-style route utilization for route-area adjustment. |
| `route_num_bins_x`, `route_num_bins_y` | Routing-utilization grid resolution. |
| `max_route_opt_adjust_rate` | Maximum route-driven area inflation rate. |
| `route_opt_adjust_exponent` | Exponent applied to the route utilization map before inflation. |
| `route_area_adjust_stop_ratio` | Stop threshold for route-area inflation. |

## Build

### Prerequisites

- Linux x86_64
- Python 3.11 + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Optional: Nix, for entering the repository development shell before sync
- System packages:
  `cmake ninja-build build-essential pkg-config libcairo2-dev libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev flex libfl-dev bison libeigen3-dev libgtest-dev`

### Dev Setup

```bash
# If Nix is available, enter the dev shell first.
nix develop

# Sync the editable development environment.
uv sync --no-build-isolation-package ecc-dreamplace --verbose
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If Nix is not available, skip `nix develop` and run the `uv sync` command in the
normal shell after installing the system packages above.

The package uses scikit-build editable rebuilds. Source edits are picked up on
the next import, and native extensions rebuild automatically when needed.

### Build Package

```bash
uv build
```

Output:

```text
dist/ecc_dreamplace-*
```

The uv build runs the package build defined by `pyproject.toml`.


### Controlling Parallelism

`ecc-dreamplace` has large C++/pybind translation units that can consume
significant memory during parallel compilation. On systems with limited memory
(for example, 24 GB), building with the default Ninja parallelism may trigger
the OOM killer or cause the system to thrash.

The build respects the `ECC_JOBS` environment variable to override the number
of parallel compilation jobs.
```
# Default: Ninja uses all available cores (may cause OOM).
nix build .#default

# Limit to 4 parallel jobs.
ECC_JOBS=4 nix build .#default --impure

# Single job (most memory-safe, recommended for constrained environments).
ECC_JOBS=1 nix build .#default --impure
```
